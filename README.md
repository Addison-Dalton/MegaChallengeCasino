# MegaChallengeCasino
Slightly more complex ASP.NET relative to the other Challenge projects. This app was made to practice with C#, ASP, and Web Forms. This is a mock slot machine app where a player can bet money on randomized slots. The player starts with $100. The app does not check for invalid characters (not numbers) as it is outside the scope of this project.
